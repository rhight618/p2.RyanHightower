<h1><strong>Project 2: Car Dashboard</strong></h1>

<h1>C: 5 Car Dashboards</h1>

<h2>1961 Ferrari GT California</h2>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Simple Design - Speedometer and Tachometer only, space not clutered with many items</li>
  <li>Viewability - the 2 meters are large and easy to see</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ol>
  <li>No Fuel Guage - Its possbile that the guage is placed elsewhere, but it would be better if it was on the dashboard</li>
  <li>No addtional guages like oil or temperature that would be helpful for safety reasons</li>
</ol>

<h2>2015 Lamborghini Avendator</h2>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Digital Display, allows the driver to choose from miltiple display options</li>
  <li>Default setting displays the Tachmometer</li>
  <li>Fuel, Oil, Temp, Oil Temp guages are lined around the Tachometer.  Makes them viewable but no taking too much space</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Dashboard space is very small, leaving no room for 2 side by side meters</li>
  <li>With multiple display options, having to switch between them can be cumbersome for the driver</li>
</ol>

<h2>1987 Ford Thunderbird</h2>

<img src="1987FordThunderbird.jpg" alt="1987 Ford Thunderbird" width="800" height="600">

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Speedometer is all digital counter, no arm.  This takes up less space on the dash</li>
  <li>Tachometer is a rising/falling level meter, no arm.  Easier to place on the dash and doesnt take up as much space</li>
  <li>Fuel and Temp guages are digital.  Overall less clutter on the dash and easy to see</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If you are accelerating quickly, the speed number jumps quickly which can make it difficult to recognize your speeed.  This also applies to braking with the speeed number dropping rapidly</li>
  <li>With many drivers at the time used to the traditional side-by-side tachometer/speedometer, it can take some time to get used to this newer style</li>
</ol>

<h2>2015 Ford Fusion</h2>

<h2>2007 Ford F150 STX</h2>

<h2>B: Car Dashboard Usage and Proposed Design</h2>

<h3>Common Car Dashboard Uses</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Tracking Speed and RPMs</li>
  <li>Meauring Engine Temp, Fuel, Oil</li>
  <li>Cruise Control</li>
  <li>Mileage/Trip Mileage Counters</li>
  <li>Safety Notifications</li>
</ol>

<h3>Rare Car Dashboard Uses</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Hands free device contol (Phones)</li>
  <li>Radio volume/station control</li>
</ol>

<h3>Dashboard Controls the User Interacts With</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Trip Mileage Count Reset Button</li>
  <li>Cruise Control Settings</li>
  <li>Right/Left Turn Signal</li>
  <li>Shifter</li>
  <li>Parking Bake</li>
  <li>Headlights</li>
  <li>Windsheild Wipers</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common Mistakes Made With Dashboards</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Forgetting that buttons 1-6 are Express Cooking Presets.  You must click Time Cook first for setting specific time</li>
  <li>Assuming that the Popcorn preset will cook for the exact correct amount of time.  If the bag is smaller you will likely scorch the popcorn</li>
</ol>

<h3>Suggested Improvements to Design</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Eliminate the Sensor Cook Menu all together because the sesnor cooking is not accurate and leaves the food undercooked/overcooked</li>
  <li>Emiminate the "Soften" Picture.  It is confusing to the user as to what he/she is supposed to do to use it.  It is not a button but merely instructions</li>
  <li>Add a section for Programable Preset buttons.  The user will be able to add a custom name and set the cooking time.  Once this is saved, the user will be able to press the button for express cooking</li>
  <li>Remove the +30 button. It is handy for adding extra time, but now the user can add a preset for that capability</li>
  <li>Add a section with a selectable alphabet so the user can for set a Preset Button name</li>
  <li>Deactivate and grey out buttons that are not selectable during preset sequences</li>
  <li>Add a readout display that gives the user better feedback and guidance while using the microwave</li>
</ol>
